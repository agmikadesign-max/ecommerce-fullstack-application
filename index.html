<!-- This file is the foundational HTML shell of your application. It typically contains a single <div> where all of your React components will be dynamically rendered. Build tools like Vite or Webpack automatically inject the bundled JavaScript files into this HTML during the build process, so you generally don't need to add a <script> tag manually. -->
